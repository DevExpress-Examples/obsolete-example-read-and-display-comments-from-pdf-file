# How to read and display comments from a PDF file

This example demonstrates how to read comments ([sticky notes](https://documentation.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/DevExpress.Pdf.PdfTextAnnotation.class)) from a PDF document with help of the [PDF Document API](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/16491/pdf-document-api) library. Retrieved comments' data is displayed in an [AccordionControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/114553/controls-and-libraries/navigation-controls/accordion-control) next to the PDF document loaded into [PDF Viewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/15216/controls-and-libraries/pdf-viewer).
